# Binary-Conveter
This is a program I made in order to understand fully how to convert denary <b>INTEGER NUMBERS</b>
to binary. If you would like to download the program and let me know if I have any bug i would be honored!!! ;-)

# Compatibility
The program it's been written in Python3.7 and is fully compatable with Python3.x.
Althought you could also run it with Python2.x programs but you may experience problems with the output nothing wierd.
Just it won't be as good as it would be in Python3.x

# Updates
I will update my repository with other programs as well like <b>FLOAT</b> number or <b>Two's Compliment</b> binary numbers.
But you will have to be patient since now it is exams period [ WOOHOOO!!! ].
